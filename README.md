# TAACS

Our project is focused on creating a tailored Time Attendance and Access Control System for workplaces. It integrates various data input devices like motion sensors, biometric scanners, and facial recognition tools. These devices feed data into our software, enabling real-time security alerts, visitor management, customizable access control, and HR tasks like leave and payroll management. This empowers administrators with valuable data insights for informed decisions. Our solution will be accessible through our user-friendly web application . Ultimately, it's designed to optimize workplace management, enhance security, and meet the evolving needs of today's organizations, ensuring efficiency, security, and an outstanding user experience.
 *(This project does not include creating face recognition algorithms.)
